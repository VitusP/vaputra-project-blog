When I entered 2020, it seemed that life is perfect and everything is going according 
to my plans: I have accepted an Internship in the Summer, I am taking challenging yet
rewarding classes while still able to contribute to the organization that I cared about.

## Then the COVID-19 enters

At first, I was not concerned about this new virus epidemic, for I thought that a pandemic
could not be possible or highly unlikely due to the distance from the ground zero of the 
virus. Life is going well, and I treated the virus as sideline news. Then I heard the 
news that the first case in my state is confirmed. Again, I thought to myself that there are
few people who got infected and that I should not be worried because the government can 
handle this. As day becomes weeks, new cases started to appear, and the government announced 
state-wide shutdown. All of my classes became online, and I need to stay at home for the 
the remainder of the semester.

I thought to myself, 
> Well, this pandemic will be over before the Summer, and everything will be back to normal

As the pandemic data and projection released, it becomes clear that this pandemic will not end
before Summer. I then heard back from my recruiter that my internship offer is getting 
rescinded. At first, it was a genuinely soul-crushing moment, for I have waited for the 
experience since the fall of last year. I was not alone; however, for a lot of my
friend's internships and study abroad are all affected in some ways. The companies
who can onboard their interns online are moving to the remote internship, and those
whose businesses affected severely by the pandemic laid-off employees and canceled the internship
program for hopeful students. 

As the neverending news keeps pouring into my mind and thought, I started to doubt my
ability and compares myself to others. I feel that I made the wrong choice for accepting 
the internship from this company and for not applying to companies who are well prepared
for this circumstance. I started blaming myself about these circumstances as if I have a full 
control of everything.

## Taking control of my thought and action
It is easy to get lost in these uncertain times, but I learned that I would not grow with this
kind of defeated mindset. 

> Gratefulness is the start of a meaningful life

Sometimes I did not get what I wanted, but it does not mean that I am not enough. When I look
back on my life, I realized that I had received numerous opportunities and gifts that help me to
be where I am now. From loving family, scholarships, and a chance to study and live in the US, all
of these are precious things that I have received, and for that, I am grateful for it.
